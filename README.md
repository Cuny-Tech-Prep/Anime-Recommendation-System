# [Anime Recommendation System](https://ctp-anime-rec-system.herokuapp.com/)

An Anime recommendation engine that displays the top 10 popular anime based on the users' ratings.
It also takes in user input, where the user can enter an anime title. The system will use that title and recommends 5 anime
using the Collaborative Filtering approach and another 5 anime using the Content Based Filtering approach.

## Motivations

Anime recommendations aren’t fine tuned to each specific person.
A recommendation engine can take the user’s interests into account and make recommendations based on it.
